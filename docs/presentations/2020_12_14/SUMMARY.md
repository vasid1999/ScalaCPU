# FURTHER WORK
## Krish
1. Focus more on timing and area optimization, since power modelling will require using proprietary tools which will also be difficult to adopt
2. Resolve the software level issues arising in the synthesis process
3. Start digging into internals of Golden Gate to see how it performs compilation and see how we can start making changes to it for latency/area optimization
