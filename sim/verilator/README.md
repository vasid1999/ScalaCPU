# Simulation using Verilator

**Verilator** is an open-source software that converts Verilog HDL into C++/SystemC files (in our case, C++), allowing the user to simulate the system by using the API functions generated by Verilator - also known as *verilating* the HDL code.

## Files
* `MyCPU.v` - generated by Chisel3 in the root directory
* `MyCPU_sim.cpp` - C++ testbench used to simulate the CPU and verify functionality
* `MyCPU_sim.h` - header file for the C++ testbench
* `mem/` - contains sample IMEM and DMEM inputs

## Usage
Copy the `MyCPU.v` file generated in the root directory (using `sbt`) into this directory, and run `make` in terminal to see a basic debug output of the CPU

## Resources on Verilator
* [Installation](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing) and [manual](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Manual-verilator)
* A nice [article](https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html) on getting started with Verilator
* A tip - the API generated can be viewed in `obj_dir/VMyCPU.h` after running `make`, which is very helpful in understanding what you can do with the verilated output
